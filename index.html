        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The Y2K panic was one of the most memorable moments of the late 1990s. As the year 2000 got closer, many people were afraid that computers around the world would stop working when the date changed from December 31, 1999, to January 1, 2000. This fear came from a simple computer problem — older systems saved the year using only two numbers, like “99” for 1999. People worried that when the year showed “00,” computers might think it was 1900 or break important programs. The technical problem was real, but the reaction became much bigger. Media stories, rumors, and growing worry turned Y2K into a cultural moment, not just a computer issue.
Traditional news played a big part in building this fear. Some newspapers and magazines made the situation sound extremely serious. For example, the 1999 Vanity Fair article “12.31.99 — The Y2K Nightmare” described possible huge disasters and helped raise public concern. But not all media agreed with the panic. The Los Angeles Times article “Awareness Is Helping Cool the Y2K Fever” (1999) tried to calm people down and said that good preparation was more important than fear. This shows that media reactions were mixed — some encouraged panic, while others pushed for a more balanced view.
At the same time, the internet was still new for many people. Online forums, chat rooms, and message boards became places where users talked about Y2K outside of newspapers and TV. These online conversations often mix real information with fear, rumors, or personal opinions. They shaped how people understood the problem, how worried they became, and how fast information spread through early internet communities.
This project looks at how these early online spaces influenced the Y2K panic. Instead of focusing only on the technical issue, it studies how people talked about Y2K online, how these discussions were different from traditional media, and what this tells us about the early internet. It also shows how these early online behaviors still shape the way people react to big technology fears today.

        <h3>The Y2K Bug: A Short Explanation</h3>
        <p>The Y2K bug came from a simple choice made in older computer systems. Many computers saved the year with only two numbers instead of four. For example, a date like “12/31/1999” was stored as “12/31/99.” When the year changed to 2000, these systems would read “00” as the year 1900. This could create mistakes in programs that use dates to compare times, do number calculations, or run automatic tasks.
People were worried because computers helped run important parts of daily life, like banks, power companies, hospitals, and airplanes. A small date error could, in theory, cause larger problems. Through the 1990s, engineers worked to fix old code, test equipment, and prepare backups just in case. The bug itself was real, but no one fully knew what might happen. Because of this uncertainty, media stories often filled the empty space with dramatic ideas about what could go wrong. For example, magazines like Vanity Fair described worst-case “global breakdown” scenarios, which made the problem sound much bigger than it was. Later research on Y2K media found that many news sources used strong, catastrophic language when talking about the bug, which helped shape how the public imagined the danger even before anything happened.

        <h3>Traditional Media and the Fear Narrative</h3>
        <p>Traditional media played a big role in spreading awareness — and sometimes worry — about Y2K. Newspapers and magazines published stories warning that everything from elevators to nuclear missiles might stop working if the bug was not fixed. Some major publications used very dramatic language, like the Vanity Fair article “12.31.99 — The Y2K Nightmare,” which described extreme global failures. TV news also added countdown graphics or special “Y2K preparedness” segments, making the problem feel more urgent.
Even when reporters tried to be balanced, headlines and visuals often made the bug seem larger and more dangerous. Talk shows invited “experts” predicting financial collapse, food shortages, or widespread power outages. A Los Angeles Times article, “Awareness Is Helping Cool the Y2K Fever” (1999), tried to give a calmer, more practical view, showing that not all media coverage was alarmist.
Researchers later studied Y2K media and found that catastrophic language was common in print outlets. The 2003 study “Millennium madness! Y2K?: A content analysis of catastrophic themes in selected print media” showed that newspapers often used fear-based framing, even when the real technical risk was limited. For many people, traditional media created uncertainty. Even if they didn’t fully believe the worst-case stories, constant coverage made it hard to ignore the possibility of serious problems. This environment set the stage for online conversations, where fears and rumors spread even faster.
