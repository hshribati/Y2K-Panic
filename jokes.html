    <h2>The Positive Side to Y2K</h2>
    <p><strong>January 1, 2000</strong></p>
    <p>Dear Valued Employee:<br>
       Re: Vacation Pay</p>
    <p>
        Our records indicate that you have not used any vacation time over the past 100 year(s). As I'm sure you are aware, employees are granted 3 weeks of paid leave per year or pay in lieu of time off. One additional week is granted for every 5 years of service. Please either take 9,400 days off work or notify our office and your next pay check will reflect payment of $8,277,432.22 which will include all pay and interest for the past 1,200 months.
    </p>
    <p>Sincerely,<br>
       Automated Payroll Processing.</p>

    <h2>The Ballad of Y2K</h2>
    <p>(sing to the tune of "Gilligan's Island")</p>

    <p>
        Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale<br>
        Of the doom that is our fate.<br>
        That started when programmers used<br>
        Two digits for a date<br>
        Two digits for a date
    </p>

    <p>
        RAM memory was smaller then;<br>
        Hard drives were tiny, too.<br>
        "Four digits are extravagant,<br>
        So let's get by with two.<br>
        So let's get by with two."
    </p>

    <p>
        "This works through 1999,"<br>
        The programmers did say.<br>
        "Unless we write new code by then<br>
        The data goes away.<br>
        The data goes away."
    </p>

    <p>
        There's not much time,<br>
        There's too much code.<br>
        (And COBOL-coders, few.)<br>
        When the century is finished with,<br>
        We may be finished, too.<br>
        We may be finished, too.
    </p>

    <p>
        Eight thousand years from now, I hope<br>
        That things weren't left too late,<br>
        And people aren't lamenting then<br>
        "Four digits for a date."<br>
        There's not much time, there's too much code,<br>
        And COBOL-coders, few.<br>
        When the century is finished,<br>
        We may be finished, too.<br>
        We may be finished, too.
